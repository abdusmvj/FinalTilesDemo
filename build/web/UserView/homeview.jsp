                Writing a great home page headline isn’t simple… but it’s not rocket surgery, either. In fact, there’s a straightforward process you can follow to move from no headline or crummy headline to optimized headline. The kind of headline that will grab visitors by the collar, pull them in close, and tell them in no uncertain terms what’s in it for them if they stick around.

I’m not talking gimmicks. I’m not talking overhyped promises. I’m talking about a logical approach to writing headlines that will actually take you from [cliché alert] zero to hero in exactly 9 steps. Starting with:
            </li>
            <li>
                But you already know it’s not that simple. If it were, headlines like “Welcome to ABCcorp.com” would be extinct, as would “AmazingProduct Saves Time & Money”.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
